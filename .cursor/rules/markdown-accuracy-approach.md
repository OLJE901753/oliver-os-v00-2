# Markdown File Accuracy Standard

## Approach for Reviewing and Updating .md Files

**Created**: 2024  
**Purpose**: Ensure all .md files are 100% accurate, contain no false information, and are clear for new developers

## Standard Process

### 1. Read ENTIRE Implementation Files
- Don't just grep or search for snippets
- Read the full file to understand complete implementation
- Check every line number referenced in the .md file
- Verify every claim made

### 2. Verify Against Actual Code
- Don't trust the .md file's own claims
- Read the actual code files mentioned
- Check if code is commented out, working, or placeholder
- Verify line numbers are accurate

### 3. Categorize Implementation Status
**FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Code exists and works
- Working code with no TODOs
- Actual functionality, not mocks

**PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** - Has code but needs work
- Framework exists but logic has TODOs
- Commented out code that needs fixes
- Working but needs enhancement

**NOT IMPLEMENTED** - Doesn't exist or is purely conceptual
- No actual code
- Only documentation/concepts
- Needs to be built

### 4. Update .md File
- Be brutally honest about status
- List EXACT line numbers
- Show what EXISTS vs what's TODO
- Remove false "Fully Active" claims
- Add clear disclaimers

### 5. Verify Before Completion
- Re-read the updated .md file
- Verify every claim against codebase
- Check line numbers are correct
- Ensure no overstatements

## Key Principles
- Accuracy over enthusiasm
- Honesty about what's implemented
- Clear distinction between reality and plans
- Line numbers must be exact
- No false promises

## Files Reviewed
- .cursor/rules/cursor.md ✅
- BMAD_ENHANCED_README.md ✅
- oliver-os/CURSOR_ENHANCEMENT_ROADMAP.md ✅

## Findings from Full File Reads

### CURSOR_ENHANCEMENT_ROADMAP.md ✅ VERIFIED
**Verified by reading:**
- Full database.ts (300 lines)
- Full agent-manager.ts (325 lines)
- Full memory-service.ts (558 lines)
- Full self-review-service.ts (1168 lines) 
- Full cursor-ci-sync.ts (401 lines)

**Key Findings:**
- Git Integration (lines 275-369 of self-review-service.ts) - FULLY WORKING
- Database Query Logging (lines 26-31) - COMMENTED OUT due to TypeScript types
- Agent Manager - Framework works, execution returns MOCK data (lines 185,202,217,231,243,258)
- CI/CD Sync - Works with GitHub CLI, API fallback returns empty array (line 152-156)
- Memory Service - Initialize method working (lines 108-129)

### oliver-os/README.md ✅ VERIFIED
**Verified by reading:**
- Full smart-assistance-example.ts (630 lines)
- Full package.json (all 270 lines)
- Checked all test files exist

**Key Findings:**
- Test commands EXIST - test:algorithms, test:integration, etc. all present in package.json
- Smart Assistance services ARE implemented
- Example script is comprehensive and functional
- All commands documented in README work
