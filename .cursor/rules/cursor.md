# Oliver OS - Cursor AI Rules Configuration

> **TOGGLE**: Set to `ENABLED` to activate Oliver OS AI Rules | Set to `DISABLED` to turn off
> 
> **STATUS**: `ENABLED` ‚úÖ

This file contains the comprehensive configuration for Oliver OS Cursor AI assistance. These features are implemented as standalone services available via example scripts, but are NOT automatically running in the main application.

## üìñ What This File Contains

This file documents AI development assistance features for the Oliver OS project. **Important**: These are NOT automatically running features. They exist as standalone services that must be manually invoked via npm commands.

### What EXISTS
- ‚úÖ Service implementations in `oliver-os/src/services/`
- ‚úÖ Example scripts in `oliver-os/examples/`
- ‚úÖ npm commands in `oliver-os/package.json`

### What DOES NOT Exist
- ‚ùå Automatic startup with main application
- ‚ùå Configuration files showing TypeScript code examples below (those are conceptual)
- ‚ùå Active integration in `oliver-os/src/index.ts`

### How to Use (For New Developers)
1. **Navigate to the oliver-os directory**: `cd oliver-os`
2. **Run a command**: e.g., `pnpm memory:all` or `pnpm review:self`
3. **The script executes**: It runs an example from `oliver-os/examples/`
4. **See the output**: The command demonstrates how the service works
5. **No integration required**: These are demonstration tools, not automatic features

**Example for a new developer:**
```bash
cd oliver-os
pnpm memory:all     # This runs the memory learning example
```

## Smart Development Interface

**Note**: The code examples below are conceptual/aspirational documentation showing ideal configurations. They do NOT exist as actual configuration files in the project. The actual implementations are in `oliver-os/src/services/` and must be invoked via example scripts.

```typescript
// Example: Smart development interface (conceptual)
interface SmartSuggestion {
  impact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  confidence: number;
  preview: string;
  action: () => void;
}
```

## üîß Available Commands

**Note**: These commands run example scripts to demonstrate the services. See `oliver-os/examples/` for actual implementations.

### Smart Development Commands
```bash
# Available via smart-assistance-example.ts
pnpm smart:analyze      # Smart code analysis
pnpm smart:suggest      # Smart suggestions
pnpm smart:refactor     # Smart refactoring
pnpm smart:quality      # Smart quality check
pnpm smart:performance  # Smart performance analysis
pnpm smart:all         # Run all smart assistance examples
```

## üß† CURSOR MEMORY AND LEARNING SYSTEM

**Status**: ‚úÖ **AVAILABLE VIA EXAMPLES** - Services implemented but must be invoked manually

### Memory and Learning Features (Available via Examples ‚úÖ)
- ‚úÖ **Session Memory**: Remember previous coding sessions and patterns - Run `pnpm memory:record`
- ‚úÖ **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from successful code patterns and decisions - Run `pnpm memory:learn`
- ‚úÖ **Contextual Suggestions**: Provide suggestions based on project history - Run `pnpm memory:suggest`
- ‚úÖ **Learning Feedback**: Improve suggestions based on user feedback - Run `pnpm memory:learn`
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Memory**: Remember architectural decisions and their rationale - Integrated in memory service
- ‚úÖ **Naming Convention Learning**: Learn and suggest naming conventions - Integrated in learning service
- ‚úÖ **Project Evolution Tracking**: Track project development over time - Integrated in memory service

### Memory Configuration
**Note**: These are example configurations showing how the services could be configured. Actual configuration is handled internally by the service implementations. See `oliver-os/src/services/memory/` for actual implementation.

### Memory Management
**Available features** (when you run `pnpm memory:*` commands):
- Memory Storage: Persistent storage in `oliver-os/cursor-memory.json`
- Memory Export/Import: Backup and restore learning data
- Memory Statistics: Track learning progress
- Memory Cleanup: Automatic cleanup of outdated data

### Learning Algorithms
**Available in the learning service** (when you run `pnpm memory:*` commands):

- Similarity Analysis: Find similar patterns and suggest improvements
- Success Rate Tracking: Track the success rate of different patterns
- Adaptive Learning: Adjust suggestions based on user feedback
- Context Awareness: Provide suggestions based on current context

**How it works**: These are features built into the services. When you run the example commands, the services use these algorithms. They are NOT running automatically in your application.

### Memory Commands
```bash
# Memory and learning commands
pnpm memory:record      # Record code patterns and decisions
pnpm memory:suggest     # Generate contextual suggestions
pnpm memory:learn       # Learn from user feedback
pnpm memory:stats       # Get memory and learning statistics
pnpm memory:export      # Export memory data
pnpm memory:import      # Import memory data
pnpm memory:clear       # Clear memory data
```

### Review Service Configuration
**Note**: Configuration for review services is handled internally by each service class. See `oliver-os/src/services/review/` for actual implementations. The services use internal defaults and can be configured via their constructor parameters when used in example scripts.

### Self-Review Commands
```bash
# Self-review and quality gate commands
pnpm review:self          # Self-review current changes
pnpm review:quality       # Quality check before commit
pnpm review:suggest       # Get improvement suggestions
pnpm review:diagram       # Generate diagrams for complex code
pnpm review:document      # Document current changes
pnpm review:check         # Full quality check
pnpm review:all           # Run all review examples
```

### Solo Development Workflow (Example Workflow)
**Note**: This is an example workflow showing how you COULD use these tools. You would run these commands manually:
```bash
# Example: How you might use review services in your workflow
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# ... make changes ...

# Run review examples (these execute demo scripts)
pnpm review:self          # Review your own changes
pnpm review:quality       # Quality check
pnpm review:suggest       # Get suggestions

# ... apply suggestions manually ...

# Final check
pnpm review:check

# Then commit normally
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature with improvements"
```

### How Services Work Together
**Note**: When you run the example commands, the services can integrate with each other. For example, memory and learning services can provide context to review services. This happens within the example scripts, not automatically in your application.

**Potential benefits when using these services**:
- Pattern Recognition: Use learned patterns for better reviews
- Learning Feedback: Improve suggestions based on user feedback  
- Context Awareness: Provide context-aware reviews
- Quality Improvement: Continuously improve code quality
- Code Quality: Consistent, thorough self-reviews
- Visual Documentation: Clear diagrams for complex sections
- Time Savings: Automated quality checks and documentation
- Consistent Standards: Apply project patterns and conventions
