 Present an overview of what you will do.

Do not generate any code until I tell you to proceed!

Why this works so well:

    Catches AI hallucinations before any code is written

    Forces me to verify if the AI actually understood my requirements

    Makes it super clear what context the AI is missing - if it doesn't mention certain files or dependencies you know are crucial, you can fix that before any code is written

    Most importantly: Exposes flaws in my own mental model of the feature

The Process:

    Describe feature to AI

    Get overview

    Spot misunderstandings or gaps

    Refine requirements

    THEN let it generate code
