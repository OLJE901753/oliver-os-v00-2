## 📝 **NOTES**

The only minor discrepancy is the GitHub badge URLs (lines 3-6) which point to a private repository. As the user clarified, these badges work when logged into GitHub, indicating they point to the correct private repository.

**Recommendation**: This is acceptable as-is. The badges function correctly for authorized users.
