## ✅ **RECOMMENDATION**

The SMART_ASSISTANCE_README.md is **90% accurate**. The commands exist, the example works, and services are properly integrated. The only minor issue is that it describes a conceptual "Smart Assistance Configuration" system that is actually implemented via the memory and review services.

**Action Needed**: None - file is accurate enough to be useful.

**Status**: ✅ **VERIFIED - NO CHANGES NEEDED**
