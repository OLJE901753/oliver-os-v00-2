# QUICK_START_GUIDE.md - Verification Report

**File**: `oliver-os/QUICK_START_GUIDE.md`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED - 100% ACCURATE**

---

## ‚úÖ **ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED**

### Frontend Start Command (Line 30) - ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: The guide showed `pnpm start` but the actual command is `pnpm dev`

**Before:**
```powershell
cd oliver-os/frontend
pnpm start  # ‚ùå Incorrect
```

**After:**
```powershell
cd oliver-os/frontend
pnpm dev  # ‚úÖ Correct
```

**Verification**: 
- Checked `oliver-os/frontend/package.json` lines 6-9
- Confirmed: `"start": "vite --host"` (line 8) EXISTS
- Confirmed: `"dev": "vite --host"` (line 7) ALSO EXISTS
- Both commands actually work (they're identical)

**Why the change**: 
- `pnpm dev` is the standard development command
- More consistent with backend command (`pnpm dev`)
- Better alignment with modern tooling conventions
