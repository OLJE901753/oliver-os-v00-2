# Markdown Review Guidelines - Status Terminology

## Status Definitions

When reviewing .md files, use these status terms:

### ‚úÖ **WORKING / FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Code exists and functions as described
- Can be run without errors
- Features are production-ready

### üöß **DEVELOPMENT / IN PROGRESS**
- Code exists but in active development
- May work but not fully tested
- Features are being improved
- **NOT production-ready**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL / MOCK DATA**
- Framework exists but returns mock data
- TODOs present in code
- Needs implementation

### ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED / CONCEPTUAL**
- Only documentation exists
- No actual code
- Aspirational features

---

## Important Notes

### "FULLY FUNCTIONAL" = Development Status
- When a file says "FULLY FUNCTIONAL" or "WORKING STATUS"
- It means **actively in development**
- NOT production-ready
- Features work but are being improved

### Example from README.md:
```
WORKING STATUS - Frontend & Backend Operational
‚úÖ FULLY FUNCTIONAL - Oliver-OS is now running
```

**This means**: "The system runs and works in development, but is actively being developed"

**NOT**: "It's production-ready and perfect"

---

## Verification Checklist

When reviewing .md files:

1. ‚úÖ Check if features actually exist in code
2. ‚úÖ Verify commands work (run or check package.json)
3. ‚úÖ Verify URLs/repos exist
4. ‚úÖ Check if status claims are accurate
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: "Development" ‚â† "Production Ready"
