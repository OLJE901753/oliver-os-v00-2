### Framework Components (Placeholder/Conceptual)
- Plugin System - Architecture defined but not fully implemented
- Report Generation - HTML/JSON/Markdown stubs exist
- Visual Dashboards - Conceptual, not implemented
- Integration Layer - Framework exists, integrations need testing

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```powershell
# Run the enhanced installation script
.\install-bmad-enhanced.ps1
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project

```bash
# For AI-brain interface projects (like Oliver-OS)
bmad init ai-brain-interface

# For microservices
bmad init microservices

# For fullstack applications
bmad init fullstack
```

### 3. Analyze Your Codebase

```bash
# Basic code analysis (note: uses framework, not comprehensive)
bmad analyze

# Analysis with depth option
bmad analyze --depth deep
```

**Note**: Analysis framework exists but provides basic metrics. Advanced features like security scanning and pattern recognition are conceptual.

### 4. Generate Reports

```bash
# Generate a report (currently outputs basic console messages)
bmad report --format html --output ./reports

# JSON format (basic output)
bmad report --format json --output ./metrics.json
```

**Note**: Report generation is currently a framework with placeholder output. Full report generation is not yet implemented.

## üéØ Core Commands

### **Break** - Task Decomposition
```bash
# Break down complex tasks (returns example breakdown)
bmad break "Implement real-time collaboration system"

# With dependency analysis (returns example)
bmad break "Add AI-powered code suggestions" --include-deps
```
**Note**: Returns example/structured breakdown, not AI-powered analysis.

### **Map** - Architecture Analysis
```bash
# Map system architecture (returns example mapping)
bmad map "oliver-os" --type architecture

# Include external dependencies (returns example)
bmad map "ai-services" --external --format mermaid
```
**Note**: Returns example architecture diagrams based on simple pattern matching, not comprehensive analysis.

### **Automate** - Process Automation
```bash
# Automate code generation (returns example file lists)
bmad automate "api-endpoints" --template rest-api --language typescript

# Generate tests automatically (returns example)
bmad automate "unit-tests" --template vitest --output tests
```
**Note**: Returns conceptual file structures and automation plans, does not actually generate code.

### **Document** - Documentation Generation
```bash
# Generate API documentation (returns example structure)
bmad document "user-service" --type api --examples

# Create comprehensive guides (returns example)
bmad document "collaboration-system" --type user-guide --format markdown
```
**Note**: Returns documentation structure and outline, does not generate actual documentation content.

## üîß Advanced Features

### **Workflow Execution**
```bash
# Execute a BMAD workflow (framework exists)
bmad workflow full-analysis

# Custom workflow with integrations (framework-level)
bmad workflow ai-integration --integrations mcp,codebuff
```
**Note**: Workflow engine exists and can execute workflows, but many workflow definitions are template examples.

### **Configuration Management**
```bash
# View current configuration (fully functional)
bmad config --list

# Set configuration values (fully functional)
bmad config --set "environments.production.debugMode=false"

# Get specific configuration value (fully functional)
bmad config --get "projectType"
```
**Note**: Configuration management is fully implemented and working.

### **System Status**
```bash
# Show BMAD system status (fully functional)
bmad status

# View recent workflow executions (framework-level)
bmad status --executions
```
**Note**: Basic status display works. Execution history is stored in memory during runtime.
