## 🔧 Issues Identified & Recommendations

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. **Security Validation** (High Priority)
   - Add input validation middleware for all endpoints
   - Implement XSS sanitization
   - Add SQL injection prevention
   - Implement rate limiting middleware
   - Add authorization checks

2. **Route Path Mismatches**
   - `/api/memory/timeline` route may not exist or has different path
   - `/api/memory/search` query parameter validation needed
   - `/api/memory/stats` route path needs verification

3. **Error Message Security**
   - Error messages leak sensitive information (database URLs, passwords)
   - Need to sanitize error messages before sending to client

### Medium Priority Issues

4. **Frontend DOM Mocking**
   - Add ResizeObserver polyfill for React Flow tests
   - Mock scrollIntoView method for Assistant Chat tests
   - Update test-setup.ts with browser API mocks

5. **Response Format Consistency**
   - GET /api/knowledge/nodes returns object instead of array
   - Standardize all API response formats

### Low Priority Issues

6. **Test Mock Improvements**
   - Service integration tests need better mock setup
   - Some tests rely on undefined mock return values
