### Memory Structure
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "lastUpdated": "timestamp",
  "codePatterns": {...},
  "architecture": {...},
  "namingConventions": {...},
  "projectHistory": {...},

}
```

## ðŸ”„ Integration Points

### With Cursor
- Pattern-based suggestions
- Context-aware code generation
- Learning from feedback
- CI/CD failure prevention
- Git-aware recommendations

### With Oliver-OS
- BMAD methodology
- Microservices architecture
- Event-driven communication
- TypeScript-first
- Quality assurance

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

âœ… All Components Complete:
- Memory service initialized (called in master-orchestrator.ts)
- Learning service operational
- CI/CD sync working (cursor-ci-sync.ts via `pnpm cursor:sync`)
- Git integration active (fully implemented in self-review-service.ts)
- Self-review functional
- AI services running (Python FastAPI services)
- `pnpm brain:maintain` command available (scripts/brain-maintain.ts)
- Vector embeddings implemented (knowledge_manager.py with ChromaDB/fallback)
- Ollama LLM integration available (ai-services/llm_provider.py, configured in settings.py)

## ðŸ“¦ Additional Features

### Agent Bridge Integration
- Python agent can send messages to Cursor AI via `/send-to-cursor`
- Python agent can communicate with TypeScript agents via `/send-to-agents`
- Enriched context includes agent memory + cursor memory
- See `AGENT_BRIDGE_README.md` for details

### Layered Memory System
- Agent memory (ai-services/memory/agent-memory.json)
- Cursor memory (cursor-memory.json)
- Memory combiner with LLM reasoning
- See `LAYERED_MEMORY_README.md` for details

## ðŸš€ Optional Next Steps

1. Set up Ollama for advanced LLM features (see `INSTALL_OLLAMA.md`)
2. Enable ChromaDB for vector embeddings (in database/docker-compose.yml)
3. Configure Neo4j for knowledge graphs (optional, has SQLite fallback)
4. Set up auto-sync scheduler for brain maintenance
5. Deploy PostgreSQL for production (currently using SQLite for development)
