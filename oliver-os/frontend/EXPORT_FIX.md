# ✅ EXPORT ISSUE FIXED!

## 🐛 Problem:
The error `doesn't provide an export named: 'objectRegistry'` was caused by missing export statements in the objectRegistry.ts file.

## 🔧 Solution:
Added the missing export statements:
- `export class ObjectRegistryManager`
- `export const objectRegistryManager`
- `export { defaultObjectRegistry as objectRegistry }`

## 🎯 Status:
The layered object system should now work properly!

## 🧪 Test Instructions:
1. **Refresh your browser** at `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Go to Neural Hub** page
3. **Enable Dev Mode** - Click "DEV MODE OFF" button
4. **Look for test object** - Black rectangle in top-left corner
5. **Click the test object** - Should show alert "Test object clicked! The layered object system is working!"

The system is now ready for your AI art assets!
